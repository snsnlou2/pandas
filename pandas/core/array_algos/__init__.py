'\ncore.array_algos is for algorithms that operate on ndarray and ExtensionArray.\nThese should:\n\n- Assume that any Index, Series, or DataFrame objects have already been unwrapped.\n- Assume that any list arguments have already been cast to ndarray/EA.\n- Not depend on Index, Series, or DataFrame, nor import any of these.\n- May dispatch to ExtensionArray methods, but should not import from core.arrays.\n'
